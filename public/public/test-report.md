# Avatar Chatbot Debug Report

## Issues Found

### 1. Server-side Issue: `req.body` is undefined
**Error:** `TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'token' of 'req.body' as it is undefined`

**Location:** `/mnt/c/users/dan/avatar-chatbot/server-trial.js:35`

**Cause:** The `express.json()` middleware is being applied after `expressWs(app)`, which causes the body parser to not work properly for regular HTTP POST requests.

**Fix:** In `server-trial.js`, move the middleware setup before `expressWs(app)`:

```javascript
// Before:
const app = express();
expressWs(app);
// ...
app.use(express.json());

// After:
const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());
expressWs(app);  // Move this after express.json()
```

### 2. Avatar Not Found Issue
**Error:** Avatar ID `avatar_d77dc4afc71e4a5ebdcd1d3bab6ca71e` is not accessible with trial tokens

**Location:** `/mnt/c/users/dan/avatar-chatbot/public/trial.html:279`

**Cause:** Trial tokens only have access to specific public avatars, not custom avatar IDs.

**Fix:** Change the avatar name to a public avatar:

```javascript
// In trial.html, line 279
// Change from:
avatarName: 'avatar_d77dc4afc71e4a5ebdcd1d3bab6ca71e',

// To one of these:
avatarName: 'josh_lite3_20230714',  // Most common trial avatar
// OR
avatarName: 'anna_public_3_20240108',  // Alternative trial avatar
// OR
avatarName: undefined,  // Let HeyGen choose default
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Fix the server-side issue first** by reordering the middleware
2. **Fix the avatar ID** in trial.html
3. **Restart the server**
4. **Test the application**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Get a trial token from https://app.heygen.com/streaming-avatar
   - Paste the token and click "Start Session"
   - The avatar should now load without errors

## Additional Notes

- The server logs show it's running in trial mode on port 3000
- The WebSocket connection for chat appears to be set up correctly
- The OpenAI integration is connected successfully
- Both `index.html` and `trial.html` use different approaches:
  - `index.html`: Uses UMD build and expects backend to provide token
  - `trial.html`: Uses ES modules and expects user to provide token

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Apply the fixes mentioned above
2. Consider adding better error handling for invalid avatar IDs
3. Add validation to ensure `req.body` exists before destructuring
4. Consider adding a list of available trial avatars in the UI
